### The Landscape

The crypto space has boomed immensely in the last few years exceeding all expectations of early adopters and sceptics alike. The significant volume being transacted on both Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) and, more recently, Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) has shown that the adoption of blockchain applications, Decentralized Finance (DeFi) in particular, is rapidly increasing.

Due in large part to the exorbitant transaction fees on the Ethereum network, several alternative low-fee ‘Ethereum Virtual Machines’ (EVMs) have recently seen immense adoption, with Binance Smartchain (BSC) being by far the most popular option for new crypto projects.

Unfortunately, many of these projects are money-grabs, scams and rug-pulls, designed only to separate investors from their hard-earned money - this has created a negative experience for most crypto buyers and dissuades all but the most daring and/or inexperienced. We aim to bring together the best clients, investors and industry professionals to make crypto a better and safer place for all investors.
