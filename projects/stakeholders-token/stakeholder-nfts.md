# Stakeholder NFTs

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/HNW NFTs.png>)

Claim your share of the HNW stakeholder revenue for LIFE by buying one (or more) of our NFTs. We have configured the Stakeholder Revenue Splitter to incorporate both NFTs and HNW staking. We did this for several reasons - NFTs can be transferred without incurring any taxes or sell pressure on the chart, and buying the NFTs will create extra demand and utility for the HNW token.

Initially, there will not be sufficient HNW available to buy all the NFTs, but we will redistribute 90% of the tokens received from sales back to the stakeholders (see following page for a breakdown).&#x20;
