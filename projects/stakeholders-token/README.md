# Stakeholder's Token

![](../../.gitbook/assets/stakeholders\_b\_1.png)

As Hobbs Networking operates within the crypto industry, we decided to integrate a token into our business structure. This gives us the flexibility to both pay team members for work done, allow investors (and clients) to benefit from the revenue generated by our services and to gain exclusive early access to future HNW projects.

Additionally, we will be minting a range of NFTs that will entitle the holder to multiple benefits, including a fixed share of the stakeholder revenue, access to VIP Telegram/Discord groups & guaranteed allocations in private sale and/or pre-sale funding rounds, when applicable. For more details on the NFTs, please refer to the NFT section.

$HNW is the ultimate stakeholder token for consistent passive income and generational wealth. All major decisions within Hobbs Networking will be made by our board of directors and funds will be held in a multi-sig wallet to ensure absolute safety for our investors and clients alike. Ultimately, the governance of HNW will shift to a DAO (initially comprising the HNW Board), which will control the project and dictate its future.
