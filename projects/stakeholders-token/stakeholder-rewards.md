# Stakeholder Rewards

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/HNW Stakholder revenue splitter.png>)

The rewards received by the stakeholders ($HNW pool staking\*, NFTs\*\* and HNW executive team) will largely be from 3 sources, namely:

1. 2.5% (2% to stakeholders & 0.5% to HNW executive team) of all transactions of $HNW.
2. 300,000 $HNW (30% of the token supply) will be locked and released at a rate of 12,000 tokens per week. These tokens will be distributed, in proportion to their share of the revenue, between all the stakeholders.
3. In addition to the share of the tax revenue AND the distribution of 30% of the entire supply $HNW, stakeholders will also receive a share of the revenue generated from future projects launched by Hobbs Networking, when negotiated accordingly on a case-by-case basis.

Thanks to the ERC-31337 token standard, we are building an enterprise-ready platform of tokens and smart contracts that all feed and support our base $HNW token. With our token technology, we can make sure $HNW will be the foundation of it all: collecting dividends from many different sources.

Therefore, the higher the transactional volume and the more successful projects we launch, the greater the rewards that will be distributed to the HNW stakeholders.

\
HNW will grow into a trusted community partner that will reward its stakeholders with consistent passive income that will grow as the project itself grows.

\* _Your % share of the $HNW staking pool determines your rewards, and will fluctuate depending on the total size of the pool_

\*\* _The tier of NFT determines the rewards you receive, and is a fixed % of the stakeholderâ€™s revenue_
