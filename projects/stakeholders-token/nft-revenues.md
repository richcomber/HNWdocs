# NFT Revenues

90% of the NFT sales revenue will be redistributed, while 10% will be retained for future endeavors. The 90% will be held in a secure multi-sig wallet affectionately known as “The Kraken”. Once the NFTs go on sale, we will release the Kraken once a week and it will be distributed as shown below. The majority of the revenue will go back to the NFT holders in order to encourage sales volume.
