# For our Clients

The Hobbs Networking “A-Z” in launch services - ensuring our clients get what they deserve: THE BEST! Equally, we won’t work with just any project – we will only engage with clients that meet our strict criteria: doxxed teams (even privately to HNW), signed agreements, contract audit, multi-sig wallets, anti-bot measures, and real utility “under the hood”.
