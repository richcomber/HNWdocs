We are primarily a start-up project incubator and provider of fund-raising, marketing, community-building and launch services - assisting start-ups with funding and support to launch their projects in a smooth, safe and battle-tested way. In addition, we also advise and assist existing teams on how to take their project to the next level.

Our goal is to allow client teams to focus on their project development and continue building functionality, while we handle the rest: secure launch, marketing, exposure, initial investors & users etc.

Not only do we bring other projects to market, we also have multiple in-house projects currently under development in our Top-Secret Skunkworks Lab - we can tell you more, but then we’d have to, well, you know…

Hobbs Networking is looking for strong project teams with a fresh, unique, and innovative vision in the crypto space. If your team needs help building interest and launching your project, you’ve come to the right place.
